Write a program to add together the integers from 1 to 100 using a while loop.  After the loop is done, display the sum.  Do not have any other output other than the sum (and don’t have any input, either).

Make sure that you use a header comment as described in the SET Coding Standard. It goes before the #include line in your C source file.  No other comments are necessary.

Call your project (and solution, but that’s a given) mini2.  Call your C source file mini2.c or mini2.cpp.  Do not create any other source files.    Follow the instructions in the SET Submission Standards and the lecture on Submitting Assignments to submit your program.  After you create your ZIP file to prepare for submission, call the ZIP file mini2.zip. Then, submit mini2.zip to the <em>Mini-Assignment 2</em> Assignment Submission Folder.

Once you have submitted your mini-assignment file, make sure that you’ve received the eConestoga e-mail confirming your submission. Do not submit that e-mail (simply keep it for your own records until you get your mark).
